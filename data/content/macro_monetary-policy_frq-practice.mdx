  <li>
    Given the Federal Reserve action you identified in part (b), draw a correctly labeled graph of the money
    market and show the effect on the nominal interest rate.
  </li>
  <li>
    The policy makers pursue a fiscal policy rather than the monetary policy in part (b). Assume that the
    marginal propensity to consume is 0.8 and the value of the recessionary gap is $300 billion.
    <ol>

        If the government changes its spending without changing taxes to eliminate the recessionary gap,
        calculate the minimum required change in government spending.

      <li>
        If the government changes taxes without changing government spending to eliminate the recessionary

    <li>
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will stay the same because lowering
      income taxes will increase consumption and/or investment, or there is no change in inputs
    </li>

    **OR**

    <li> 
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will increase in the long run because
      lowering taxes will increase savings and investment in physical capital, or because of increased
      incentives to work.
    </li>

    **OR**

    <li>
      +1 for stating that long-run aggregate supply will decrease in the long run
      because lowering taxes leads to a crowding out of private investment.

          There is a time lag between enaction and effect of monetary policy.

        </li>

    <li>
      +1  for any of the following

          Increasing government spending leads to crowding out, where government spending “crowds out” private spending. This may have an adverse effect on economic stimulus.

            Fiscal policy is enacted by the government, while monetary policy is in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Fiscal policy is usually a bit slower in response to the economy due to the fact that it has to get through Congress and the Executive branch.
